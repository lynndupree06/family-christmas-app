<%= @user.first_name %>, are you ready for Christmas?

  <% if @items.size == 0 %>
    You don't have anything on your list! You need to catch up and make sure you have something by <%= Date.parse(ENV['GIFT_DEADLINE']).to_date.strftime("%A, %B %d") %>. You don't want to wait until the last minute.
  <% elsif @items.size > 0 && @items.size < 6 %>
    Do you think you have enough items to cover the amount of people that may be getting you a gift? Maybe spend some more time adding a few more gifts. We are shooting to have gifts in by <%= Date.parse(ENV['GIFT_DEADLINE']).to_date.strftime("%A, %B %d") %>, so don't wait until the last minute!
  <% elsif @items.size >= 6 %>
    It looks like you are all set!
  <% end %>

    Try to encourage some of these other family members to update their lists as well:

      <% @otherMembers.each do |m| %>
        <% if m[:items] < 6 %>
          - <%= m[:name] %> only has <%= pluralize(m[:items], 'item') %>
        <% end %>
      <% end %>

  <% if @items.size > 0 %>
    These are the things that are currently on your list:

      <% @items.each do |item| %>
        - <%= item.title %>
      <% end %>
  <% end %>
